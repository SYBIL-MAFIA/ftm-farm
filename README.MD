The script is based on the FTMâ†’MIM token pair and includes additional features that allow you 
to run it for a large account farm.

## Script Features:

2. Support for withdrawing FTM from your OKX account to all FTM wallets for script usage.
3. Purchase of MIM through 1inch.
4. Proxy support (optional).

## Instructions for Running the Script:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
